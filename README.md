# AWS Static Website Deployment

This project aims to deploy a secure and scalable static website on AWS S3, optimizing content delivery by modifying bucket permissions and properties.

## Overview

In this project, we utilize Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host a static website on Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service). By leveraging the robust features of S3, we ensure secure and efficient delivery of web content to users. Additionally, we optimize content delivery by modifying bucket permissions and properties, thereby enhancing the website's performance and scalability.

## Features

- **Secure Deployment**: The website is hosted on AWS S3, ensuring data security and reliability.
- **Scalability**: Leveraging AWS infrastructure enables seamless scalability to accommodate varying levels of traffic.
- **Optimized Content Delivery**: By modifying bucket permissions and properties, we enhance content delivery efficiency, resulting in improved user experience.
- **Cost-effective**: Hosting a static website on S3 is cost-effective, making it an ideal solution for projects with budget constraints.

## Deployment Process

1. **AWS Account Setup**: Ensure you have an AWS account set up with necessary permissions to create and manage S3 buckets.
2. **Static Website Creation**: Develop your static website or use existing content to deploy.
3. **AWS S3 Bucket Creation**: Create an S3 bucket to host your website content. Ensure to enable static website hosting in the bucket properties.
4. **Bucket Permissions Modification**: Modify bucket permissions to allow public access to the website content while maintaining security.
5. **Content Optimization**: Optimize bucket properties for improved content delivery, including setting cache-control headers and configuring compression.
6. **Upload Website Content**: Upload your website files to the S3 bucket.
7. **Testing**: Test the deployed website to ensure proper functionality and optimized content delivery.
8. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Regularly monitor website performance and make necessary adjustments to maintain optimal performance and security.
